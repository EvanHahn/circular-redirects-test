Circular redirects test
=======================

This is a small Node app that has a circular redirect with HTTP 302s.

`/a` redirects to `/b` which redirects to `/c` which redirects back to `/a`.

Get the app running
-------------------

- install Node 6+
- clone this project and `cd` inside
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm start` to start the app

Why?
----

I wanted to test something.
